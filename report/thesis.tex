\subsection{Introduction}

Counting triangles is a fundamental problem in graph theory with widespread applications in social networks, bioinformatics, and more.
These triangles, formed by three mutually connected nodes, can, in social network graphs, represent closed friendships, indicating a high level of local connectivity, which can give great insite into the network as a whole.
However, for large graphs, especially sparse ones, where the number of edges is much smaller compared to the number of possible edges, efficiently counting these triangles poses significant computational challenges.

\subsection{Methods for Triangle Counting}

There are a few trivial methods for triangle counting.
Primarily, we an use a brute force technique in which we enumerate all distinct sets of three vertices ${u, v, w}$ and check if they form a triangle.
This involves examining every possible combination of vertices in the graph and testing whether all three edges $(u, v)$, $(v, w)$, and $(w, u)$ exist.
Assuming, optimally, that we have edges stored in a hash table where retrival takes $O(1)$ time, the time complexity of this brute force approach is $\Theta(n^3)$, since the number of such three-vertex sets grows cubically with the number of vertices. \cite{al_hasan_triangle_2018}
This method is straightforward but inefficient for large graphs due to its high computational cost.

While for smaller graphs, this runtime is acceptable, when dealing with larger graphs, such as those representing large social netwworks, a $\Theta(n^3)$ runtime becomes impractical.


\subsection{Recycling Bin DELETE LATER}

To address this, we turn toward randomized algorithms. These algorithms rely on probabilistic techniques to sample subsets of the graph's nodes, estimating the global triangle count based on local observations.
By doing this, these algorithms significantly reduce the runtime compared to exact methods, particularly in sparse graphs where only a fraction of potential edges exist.
Additionally, randomized algorithms often provide tunable accuracy, allowing for a trade-off between precision and performance, making them ideal for processing large-scale networks.
