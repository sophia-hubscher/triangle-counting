	abstract = {Graphs are used to model interactions in a variety of contexts, and there is a growing need to quickly assess the structure of a graph. Some of the most useful graph metrics, especially those measuring social cohesion, are based on triangles. Despite the importance of these triadic measures, associated algorithms can be extremely expensive. We propose a new method based on wedge sampling. This versatile technique allows for the fast and accurate approximation of all current variants of clustering coefficients and enables rapid uniform sampling of the triangles of a graph. Our methods come with provable and practical time-approximation tradeoffs for all computations. We provide extensive results that show our methods are orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art, while providing nearly the accuracy of full enumeration. Our results will enable more wide-scale adoption of triadic measures for analysis of extremely large graphs, as demonstrated on several real-world examples.},

	abstract = {Counting the number of triangles in a graph is a beautiful algorithmic problem which has gained importance over the last years due to its significant role in complex network analysis. Metrics frequently computed such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity ratio involve the execution of a triangle counting algorithm. Furthermore, several interesting graph mining applications rely on computing the number of triangles in the graph of interest.In this paper, we focus on the problem of counting triangles in a graph. We propose a practical method, out of which all triangle counting algorithms can potentially benefit. Using a straightforward triangle counting algorithm as a black box, we performed 166 experiments on real-world networks and on synthetic datasets as well, where we show that our method works with high accuracy, typically more than 99\% and gives significant speedups, resulting in even ≈ 130 times faster performance.},

	abstract = {How can we quickly find the number of triangles in a large graph, without actually counting them? Triangles are important for real world social networks, lying at the heart of the clustering coefficient and of the transitivity ratio. However, straight-forward and even approximate counting algorithms can be slow, trying to execute or approximate the equivalent of a 3-way database join. In this paper, we provide two algorithms, the eigentriangle for counting the total number of triangles in a graph, and the eigentrianglelocal algorithm that gives the count of triangles that contain a desired node. Additional contributions include the following: (a) We show that both algorithms achieve excellent accuracy, with up to sime 1000x faster execution time, on several, real graphs and (b) we discover two new power laws (degree-triangle and triangleparticipation laws) with surprising properties.},

	abstract = {Counting and enumeration of local topological structures, such as triangles, is an important task for analyzing large real‐life networks. For instance, triangle count in a network is used to compute transitivity—an important property for understanding graph evolution over time. Triangles are also used for various other tasks completed for real‐life networks, including community discovery, link prediction, and spam filtering. The task of triangle counting, though simple, has gained wide attention in recent years from the data mining community. This is due to the fact that most of the existing algorithms for counting triangles do not scale well to very large networks with millions (or even billions) of vertices. To circumvent this limitation, researchers proposed triangle counting methods that approximate the count or run on distributed clusters. In this paper, we discuss the existing methods of triangle counting, ranging from sequential to parallel, single‐machine to distributed, exact to approximate, and off‐line to streaming. We also present experimental results of performance comparison among a set of approximate triangle counting methods built under a unified implementation framework. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future works in this direction.
