Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks ‘rewired’ to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them ‘small-world’ networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

Here we review the recent advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data that motivated the recent interest in networks, we discuss the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks, as well as the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against failures and attacks.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present the first efficient and practical algorithm for estimating the number of triangles in a graph stream using predictions. Our algorithm combines waiting room sampling and reservoir sampling with a predictor for the heaviness of edges, that is, the number of triangles in which an edge is involved. As a result, our algorithm is fast, provides guarantees on the amount of memory used, and exploits the additional information provided by the predictor to produce highly accurate estimates. We also propose a simple and domain-independent predictor, based on the degree of nodes, that can be easily computed with one pass on a stream of edges when the stream is available beforehand. Our analytical results show that, when the predictor provides useful information on the heaviness of edges, it leads to estimates with reduced variance compared to the state-of-the-art, even when the predictions are far from perfect. Our experimental results show that, when analyzing a single graph stream, our algorithm is faster than the state-of-the-art for a given memory budget, while providing significantly more accurate estimates. Even more interestingly, when sequences of hundreds of graph streams are analyzed, our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art using our simple degree-based predictor built by analyzing only the first graph of the sequence.},

In particular, the new bound on \${\textbackslash}omega\$ is \${\textbackslash}omega{\textbackslash}le 2.371552\$ (improved from \${\textbackslash}omega{\textbackslash}le 2.371866\$). For the dual matrix multiplication exponent \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ defined as the largest \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ for which \${\textbackslash}omega(1,{\textbackslash}alpha,1)=2\$, we obtain the improvement \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}ge 0.321334\$ (improved from \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}ge 0.31389\$).

Triangles are important for real world social networks, lying at the heart of the clustering coefficient and of the transitivity ratio. However, straight-forward and even approximate counting algorithms can be slow, trying to execute or approximate the equivalent of a 3-way database join. In this paper, we provide two algorithms, the eigentriangle for counting the total number of triangles in a graph, and the eigentrianglelocal algorithm that gives the count of triangles that contain a desired node. Additional contributions include the following: (a) We show that both algorithms achieve excellent accuracy, with up to sime 1000x faster execution time, on several, real graphs and (b) we discover two new power laws (degree-triangle and triangleparticipation laws) with surprising properties.},

This versatile technique allows for the fast and accurate approximation of all current variants of clustering coefficients and enables rapid uniform sampling of the triangles of a graph. Our methods come with provable and practical time-approximation tradeoffs for all computations. We provide extensive results that show our methods are orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art, while providing nearly the accuracy of full enumeration. Our results will enable more wide-scale adoption of triadic measures for analysis of extremely large graphs, as demonstrated on several real-world examples.},

	title = {Faster {Matchings} via {Learned} {Duals}},
	abstract = {A recent line of research investigates how algorithms can be augmented with machine-learned predictions to overcome worst case lower bounds. This area has revealed interesting algorithmic insights into problems, with particular success in the design of competitive online algorithms. However, the question of improving algorithm running times with predictions has largely been unexplored. We take a first step in this direction by combining the idea of machine-learned predictions with the idea of "warm-starting" primal-dual algorithms. We consider one of the most important primitives in combinatorial optimization: weighted bipartite matching and its generalization to \$b\$-matching. We identify three key challenges when using learned dual variables in a primal-dual algorithm. First, predicted duals may be infeasible, so we give an algorithm that efficiently maps predicted infeasible duals to nearby feasible solutions. Second, once the duals are feasible, they may not be optimal, so we show that they can be used to quickly find an optimal solution. Finally, such predictions are useful only if they can be learned, so we show that the problem of learning duals for matching has low sample complexity. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments on both real and synthetic data. As a result we give a rigorous, practical, and empirically effective method to compute bipartite matchings.},

	abstract = {Counting and enumeration of local topological structures, such as triangles, is an important task for analyzing large real‐life networks. For instance, triangle count in a network is used to compute transitivity—an important property for understanding graph evolution over time. Triangles are also used for various other tasks completed for real‐life networks, including community discovery, link prediction, and spam filtering. The task of triangle counting, though simple, has gained wide attention in recent years from the data mining community. This is due to the fact that most of the existing algorithms for counting triangles do not scale well to very large networks with millions (or even billions) of vertices. To circumvent this limitation, researchers proposed triangle counting methods that approximate the count or run on distributed clusters. In this paper, we discuss the existing methods of triangle counting, ranging from sequential to parallel, single‐machine to distributed, exact to approximate, and off‐line to streaming. We also present experimental results of performance comparison among a set of approximate triangle counting methods built under a unified implementation framework. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of future works in this direction.

	abstract = {Online social networks regularly offer users personalized, algorithmic suggestions of whom to connect to. Here we examine the aggregate effects of such recommendations on network structure, focusing on whether these recommendations increase the popularity of niche users or, conversely, those who are already popular. We investigate this issue by empirically and theoretically analyzing abrupt changes in Twitter's network structure around the mid-2010 introduction of its "Who to Follow" feature. We find that users across the popularity spectrum benefitted from the recommendations; however, the most popular users profited substantially more than average. We trace this "rich get richer" phenomenon to three intertwined factors. First, as is typical of network recommenders, the system relies on a "friend-of-friend"-style algorithm, which we show generally results in users being recommended proportional to their degree. Second, we find that the baseline growth rate of users is sublinear in degree. This mismatch between the recommender and the natural network dynamics thus alters the structural evolution of the network. Finally, we find that people are much more likely to respond positively to recommendations for popular users---perhaps because of their greater name recognition---further amplifying the cumulative advantage of well-known individuals.},

Our distributed-memory parallel algorithm allows us to deal with such massive networks in a time- and space-efficient manner. We were able to count triangles in a graph with 2 billions of nodes and 50 billions of edges in 10 minutes. Our parallel algorithm for computing clustering coefficients uses efficient external memory aggregation. We also show how edge sparsification technique can be used with our parallel algorithm to find approximate number of triangles without sacrificing the accuracy of estimation.

	abstract = {Triangle counting is an important problem in graph mining with several real-world applications. Interesting metrics, such as the clustering coefficient and the transitivity ratio, involve computing the number of triangles. Furthermore, several interesting graph mining applications rely on computing the number of triangles in a large-scale graph. However, exact triangle counting is expensive and memory consuming, and current approximation algorithms are unsatisfactory and not practical for very large-scale graphs. In this paper we present a new highly-parallel randomized algorithm for approximating the number of triangles in an undirected graph. Our algorithm uses a well-known relation between the number of triangles and the trace of the cubed adjacency matrix. A Monte-Carlo simulation is used to estimate this quantity. Each sample requires O({\textbar}E{\textbar}) time and O(ǫ 2 log(1/δ)ρ(G) 2 ) samples are required to guarantee an (ǫ, δ)-approximation, where ρ(G) is a measure of the triangle sparsity of G (ρ(G) is not necessarily small). Our algorithm requires only O({\textbar}V {\textbar}) space in order to work efficiently. We present experiments that demonstrate that in practice usually only O(log 2 {\textbar}V {\textbar}) samples are required to get good approximations for graphs frequently encountered in data-mining tasks, and that our algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art approximate triangle counting methods both in terms of accuracy and in terms of running-time. The use of Monte-Carlo simulation support parallelization well: our algorithm is embarrassingly parallel with a critical path of only O({\textbar}E{\textbar}), achievable on as few as O(log 2 {\textbar}V {\textbar}) processors.},
